**GITHUB USERS: If you do not do this, it will FAIL completely. Permissions must be set.**

```bash
chmod +x set-permissions.sh
./set-permissions.sh
```

## Manual installation (easy)

The easiest way to install the extension (for development and local use) is by running:
```bash
./local_install.sh
```
It automatically performs  the commands from the next section.

It is recommended to delete the destination folder ($HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/desktopicons-neo@darkdemon) before doing this to ensure that no old data is kept.

## Build with Meson

The project uses a build system called ['Meson'](https://mesonbuild.com/). You can install
in most Linux distributions as "meson". You also need "ninja" and xgettext, both of which are automatically installed with the 'meson' package in most package managers.

```bash
meson --prefix=$HOME/.local/ --localedir=share/gnome-shell/extensions/desktopicons-neo@darkdemon/locale .build
ninja -C .build install
```

It's possible to read more information in the Meson docs to tweak the configuration if needed.

## Export extension ZIP file for extensions.gnome.org

To create a ZIP file of the project certified for use on extensions.gnome.org, run:

```bash
./export-zip.sh
```

This will create the file `desktopicons-neo@darkdemon.zip` containing the extension. The zip file follows the rules for publishing at extensions.gnome.org.
